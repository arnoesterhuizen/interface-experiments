	<p>Genetics deals with the <a href="/wiki/Molecular_Genetics" title="Molecular Genetics" class="mw-redirect">molecular structure and function</a> of genes, gene behavior in context of a <a href="/wiki/Cell_%28biology%29" title="Cell (biology)">cell</a> or <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organism</a> (e.g. <a href="/wiki/Dominance_%28genetics%29" title="Dominance (genetics)">dominance</a> and <a href="/wiki/Epigenetics" title="Epigenetics">epigenetics</a>), patterns of inheritance from parent to offspring, and gene distribution, variation and change in <a href="/wiki/Population_genetics" title="Population genetics">populations</a>. Given that genes are universal to living organisms, genetics can be applied to the study of all living systems, from <a href="/wiki/Virus" title="Virus">viruses</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bacteria" title="Bacteria">bacteria</a>, through <a href="/wiki/Plant" title="Plant">plants</a> and <a href="/wiki/Domestic_animals" title="Domestic animals" class="mw-redirect">domestic animals</a>, to <a href="/wiki/Human" title="Human">humans</a> (as in <a href="/wiki/Medical_genetics" title="Medical genetics">medical genetics</a>).</p>
	<p>The fact that living things inherit traits from their parents has been used since prehistoric times to improve crop plants and animals through <a href="/wiki/Selective_breeding" title="Selective breeding">selective breeding</a>. However, the modern science of genetics, which seeks to understand the process of inheritance, only began with the work of <a href="/wiki/Gregor_Mendel" title="Gregor Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a> in the mid-19th century.<sup id="cite_ref-Weiling_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Weiling-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Although he did not know the physical basis for heredity, Mendel observed that organisms inherit traits via <a href="/wiki/Countable_set" title="Countable set">discrete</a> units of inheritance, which are now called <a href="/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">genes</a>.</p>
	<p>Genes correspond to regions within <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a>, a molecule composed of a chain of four different types of <a href="/wiki/Nucleotides" title="Nucleotides" class="mw-redirect">nucleotides</a>—the sequence of these nucleotides is the genetic information organisms inherit. DNA naturally occurs in a double stranded form, with nucleotides on each strand complementary to each other. Each strand can act as a template for <a href="/wiki/DNA_replication" title="DNA replication">creating</a> a new partner strand. This is the physical method for making copies of genes that can be inherited.</p>
	<p>The sequence of nucleotides in a gene is <a href="/wiki/Translation_%28genetics%29" title="Translation (genetics)" class="mw-redirect">translated</a> by cells to produce a chain of <a href="/wiki/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>, creating <a href="/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a>—the order of amino acids in a protein corresponds to the order of nucleotides in the gene. This relationship between nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence is known as the <a href="/wiki/Genetic_code" title="Genetic code">genetic code</a>. The amino acids in a protein determine how it folds into a three-dimensional shape; this structure is, in turn, responsible for the protein's function. Proteins carry out almost all the functions needed for cells to live. A change to the DNA in a gene can change a protein's amino acids, changing its shape and function: this can have a dramatic effect in the cell and on the organism as a whole.</p>
	<p>Although genetics plays a large role in the appearance and behavior of organisms, it is the combination of genetics with what an organism experiences that determines the ultimate outcome. For example, while genes play a role in determining an organism's <a href="/wiki/Human_height" title="Human height">size</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Nutrition" title="Nutrition">nutrition</a> and <a href="/wiki/Health" title="Health">health</a> it experiences after inception also have a large effect.</p>

	<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="History">History</span></h2>

	<p>Although the science of genetics began with the applied and theoretical work of <a href="/wiki/Gregor_Mendel" title="Gregor Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a> in the mid-19th century, other theories of inheritance preceded Mendel. A popular theory during Mendel's time was the concept of <a href="/wiki/Blending_inheritance" title="Blending inheritance">blending inheritance</a>: the idea that individuals inherit a smooth blend of traits from their parents. Mendel's work disproved this, showing that traits are composed of combinations of distinct genes rather than a continuous blend. Another theory that had some support at that time was the <a href="/wiki/Inheritance_of_acquired_characteristics" title="Inheritance of acquired characteristics">inheritance of acquired characteristics</a>: the belief that individuals inherit traits strengthened by their parents. This theory (commonly associated with <a href="/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck" title="Jean-Baptiste Lamarck">Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a>) is now known to be wrong—the experiences of individuals do not affect the genes they pass to their children.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> Other theories included the <a href="/wiki/Pangenesis" title="Pangenesis">pangenesis</a> of <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin" title="Charles Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> (which had both acquired and inherited aspects) and <a href="/wiki/Francis_Galton" title="Francis Galton">Francis Galton</a>'s reformulation of pangenesis as both particulate and inherited.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
	<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mendelian_and_classical_genetics">Mendelian and classical genetics</span></h3>
	<p>Modern genetics started with <a href="/wiki/Gregor_Johann_Mendel" title="Gregor Johann Mendel" class="mw-redirect">Gregor Johann Mendel</a>, a German-Czech Augustinian <a href="/wiki/Monk" title="Monk">monk</a> and scientist who studied the nature of inheritance in plants. In his paper "Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden" ("<a href="/wiki/Experiments_on_Plant_Hybridization" title="Experiments on Plant Hybridization">Experiments on Plant Hybridization</a>"), presented in 1865 to the <i>Naturforschender Verein</i> (Society for Research in Nature) in <a href="/wiki/Br%C3%BCnn" title="Brünn" class="mw-redirect">Brünn</a>, Mendel traced the inheritance patterns of certain traits in pea plants and described them mathematically.<sup id="cite_ref-mendel_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mendel-8"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Although this pattern of inheritance could only be observed for a few traits, Mendel's work suggested that heredity was particulate, not acquired, and that the inheritance patterns of many traits could be explained through simple rules and ratios.</p>
	<p>The importance of Mendel's work did not gain wide understanding until the 1890s, after his death, when <a href="/wiki/Hugo_de_Vries" title="Hugo de Vries">other scientists</a> working on similar problems re-discovered his research. <a href="/wiki/William_Bateson" title="William Bateson">William Bateson</a>, a proponent of Mendel's work, coined the word <i>genetics</i> in 1905.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> (The adjective <i>genetic</i>, derived from the Greek word <i>genesis</i>—γένεσις, "origin", predates the noun and was first used in a biological sense in 1860.)<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> Bateson popularized the usage of the word <i>genetics</i> to describe the study of inheritance in his inaugural address to the Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London, England</a>, in 1906.<sup id="cite_ref-bateson_genetics_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bateson_genetics-12"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
	<p>After the rediscovery of Mendel's work, scientists tried to determine which molecules in the cell were responsible for inheritance. In 1910, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Hunt_Morgan" title="Thomas Hunt Morgan">Thomas Hunt Morgan</a> argued that genes are on <a href="/wiki/Chromosome" title="Chromosome">chromosomes</a>, based on observations of a sex-linked <a href="/wiki/White_%28mutation%29" title="White (mutation)">white eye</a> mutation in <a href="/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster" title="Drosophila melanogaster">fruit flies</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1913, his student <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Sturtevant" title="Alfred Sturtevant">Alfred Sturtevant</a> used the phenomenon of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_linkage" title="Genetic linkage">genetic linkage</a> to show that genes are arranged linearly on the chromosome.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
	<p><span id="molecular"></span></p>

	<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Molecular_genetics">Molecular genetics</span></h3>
	<p>Although genes were known to exist on chromosomes, chromosomes are composed of both protein and DNA—scientists did not know which of these is responsible for inheritance. In 1928, <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Griffith" title="Frederick Griffith">Frederick Griffith</a> discovered the phenomenon of <a href="/wiki/Transformation_%28genetics%29" title="Transformation (genetics)">transformation</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Griffith%27s_experiment" title="Griffith's experiment">Griffith's experiment</a>): dead bacteria could transfer <a href="/wiki/Genetic_material" title="Genetic material" class="mw-redirect">genetic material</a> to "transform" other still-living bacteria. Sixteen years later, in 1944, <a href="/wiki/Oswald_Theodore_Avery" title="Oswald Theodore Avery" class="mw-redirect">Oswald Theodore Avery</a>, <a href="/wiki/Colin_McLeod" title="Colin McLeod" class="mw-redirect">Colin McLeod</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maclyn_McCarty" title="Maclyn McCarty">Maclyn McCarty</a> identified the molecule responsible for transformation as <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Avery_et_al_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Avery_et_al-15"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="/wiki/Hershey-Chase_experiment" title="Hershey-Chase experiment" class="mw-redirect">Hershey-Chase experiment</a> in 1952 also showed that DNA (rather than protein) is the genetic material of the viruses that infect bacteria, providing further evidence that DNA is the molecule responsible for inheritance.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
	<p><a href="/wiki/James_D._Watson" title="James D. Watson">James D. Watson</a> and <a href="/wiki/Francis_Crick" title="Francis Crick">Francis Crick</a> determined the structure of DNA in 1953, using the <a href="/wiki/X-ray_crystallography" title="X-ray crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a> work of <a href="/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin" title="Rosalind Franklin">Rosalind Franklin</a> and <a href="/wiki/Maurice_Wilkins" title="Maurice Wilkins">Maurice Wilkins</a> that indicated DNA had a <a href="/wiki/Helical" title="Helical" class="mw-redirect">helical</a> structure (i.e., shaped like a corkscrew).<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-watsoncrick_1953a_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-watsoncrick_1953a-18"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Their double-helix model had two strands of DNA with the nucleotides pointing inward, each matching a complementary nucleotide on the other strand to form what looks like rungs on a twisted ladder.<sup id="cite_ref-watsoncrick_1953b_19-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-watsoncrick_1953b-19"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> This structure showed that genetic information exists in the sequence of nucleotides on each strand of DNA. The structure also suggested a simple method for duplication: if the strands are separated, new partner strands can be reconstructed for each based on the sequence of the old strand.</p>
	<p>Although the structure of DNA showed how inheritance works, it was still not known how DNA influences the behavior of cells. In the following years, scientists tried to understand how DNA controls the process of <a href="/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">protein</a> production. It was discovered that the cell uses DNA as a template to create matching <a href="/wiki/Messenger_RNA" title="Messenger RNA">messenger RNA</a> (a molecule with nucleotides, very similar to DNA). The nucleotide sequence of a messenger RNA is used to create an <a href="/wiki/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acid</a> sequence in protein; this translation between nucleotide and amino acid sequences is known as the <a href="/wiki/Genetic_code" title="Genetic code">genetic code</a>.</p>
	<p>With this molecular understanding of inheritance, an explosion of research became possible. One important development was chain-termination <a href="/wiki/DNA_sequencing" title="DNA sequencing">DNA sequencing</a> in 1977 by <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Sanger" title="Frederick Sanger">Frederick Sanger</a>. This technology allows scientists to read the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule.<sup id="cite_ref-sanger_et_al_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-sanger_et_al-20"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> In 1983, <a href="/wiki/Kary_Banks_Mullis" title="Kary Banks Mullis" class="mw-redirect">Kary Banks Mullis</a> developed the <a href="/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction" title="Polymerase chain reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a>, providing a quick way to isolate and amplify a specific section of a DNA from a mixture.<sup id="cite_ref-saiki_et_al_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-saiki_et_al-21"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> Through the pooled efforts of the <a href="/wiki/Human_Genome_Project" title="Human Genome Project">Human Genome Project</a> and the parallel private effort by <a href="/wiki/Celera_Genomics" title="Celera Genomics" class="mw-redirect">Celera Genomics</a>, these and other methods culminated in the sequencing of the <a href="/wiki/Human_genome" title="Human genome">human genome</a> in 2003.<sup id="cite_ref-human_genome_project_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-human_genome_project-22"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

	<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Discrete_inheritance_and_Mendel.27s_laws">Discrete inheritance and Mendel's laws</span></h3>


	<p>At its most fundamental level, inheritance in organisms occurs by means of discrete traits, called <a href="/wiki/Gene" title="Gene">genes</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-griffiths2000sect199_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-griffiths2000sect199-23"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> This property was first observed by <a href="/wiki/Gregor_Mendel" title="Gregor Mendel">Gregor Mendel</a>, who studied the segregation of heritable traits in <a href="/wiki/Pea" title="Pea">pea</a> plants.<sup id="cite_ref-mendel_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-mendel-8"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-griffiths2000sect200_24-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-griffiths2000sect200-24"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> In his experiments studying the trait for flower color, Mendel observed that the flowers of each pea plant were either purple or white—but never an intermediate between the two colors. These different, discrete versions of the same gene are called <a href="/wiki/Allele" title="Allele">alleles</a>.</p>
	<p>In the case of pea, which is a <a href="/wiki/Diploid" title="Diploid" class="mw-redirect">diploid</a> species, each individual plant has two copies of each gene, one copy inherited from each parent.<sup id="cite_ref-griffiths2000sect484_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-griffiths2000sect484-25"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup> Many species, including humans, have this pattern of inheritance. Diploid organisms with two copies of the same allele of a given gene are called <a href="/wiki/Homozygous" title="Homozygous" class="mw-redirect">homozygous</a> at that <a href="/wiki/Locus_%28genetics%29" title="Locus (genetics)">gene locus</a>, while organisms with two different alleles of a given gene are called <a href="/wiki/Heterozygous" title="Heterozygous" class="mw-redirect">heterozygous</a>.</p>
	<p>The set of alleles for a given organism is called its <a href="/wiki/Genotype" title="Genotype">genotype</a>, while the observable traits of the organism are called its <a href="/wiki/Phenotype" title="Phenotype">phenotype</a>. When organisms are heterozygous at a gene, often one allele is called <a href="/wiki/Dominant_allele" title="Dominant allele" class="mw-redirect">dominant</a> as its qualities dominate the phenotype of the organism, while the other allele is called <a href="/wiki/Recessive_allele" title="Recessive allele" class="mw-redirect">recessive</a> as its qualities recede and are not observed. Some alleles do not have complete dominance and instead have <a href="/wiki/Dominance_relationship#Incomplete_and_semi-dominance" title="Dominance relationship" class="mw-redirect">incomplete dominance</a> by expressing an intermediate phenotype, or <a href="/wiki/Dominance_relationship#Co-dominance" title="Dominance relationship" class="mw-redirect">codominance</a> by expressing both alleles at once.<sup id="cite_ref-griffiths2000sect630_26-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-griffiths2000sect630-26"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
	<p>When a pair of organisms <a href="/wiki/Sexual_reproduction" title="Sexual reproduction">reproduce sexually</a>, their offspring randomly inherit one of the two alleles from each parent. These observations of discrete inheritance and the segregation of alleles are collectively known as <a href="/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance#Law_of_Segregation" title="Mendelian inheritance">Mendel's first law</a> or the Law of Segregation.</p>
	<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Notation_and_diagrams">Notation and diagrams</span></h3>

	<p>Geneticists use diagrams and symbols to describe inheritance. A gene is represented by one or a few letters. Often a "+" symbol is used to mark the usual, <a href="/wiki/Wild_type" title="Wild type">non-mutant allele</a> for a gene.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
	<p>In fertilization and breeding experiments (and especially when discussing Mendel's laws) the parents are referred to as the "P" generation and the offspring as the "F1" (first filial) generation. When the F1 offspring mate with each other, the offspring are called the "F2" (second filial) generation. One of the common diagrams used to predict the result of cross-breeding is the <a href="/wiki/Punnett_square" title="Punnett square">Punnett square</a>.</p>
	<p>When studying human genetic diseases, geneticists often use <a href="/wiki/Pedigree_chart" title="Pedigree chart">pedigree charts</a> to represent the inheritance of traits.<sup id="cite_ref-griffiths2000sect229_28-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-griffiths2000sect229-28"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup> These charts map the inheritance of a trait in a family tree.</p>
	<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Interactions_of_multiple_genes">Interactions of multiple genes</span></h3>

	<p>Organisms have thousands of genes, and in sexually reproducing organisms these genes generally assort independently of each other. This means that the inheritance of an allele for yellow or green pea color is unrelated to the inheritance of alleles for white or purple flowers. This phenomenon, known as "<a href="/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance#Law_of_Independent_Assortment_.28The_.22Second_Law.22.29" title="Mendelian inheritance">Mendel's second law</a>" or the "Law of independent assortment", means that the alleles of different genes get shuffled between parents to form offspring with many different combinations. (Some genes do not assort independently, demonstrating <a href="/wiki/Genetic_linkage" title="Genetic linkage">genetic linkage</a>, a topic discussed later in this article.)</p>
	<p>Often different genes can interact in a way that influences the same trait. In the <a href="/wiki/Blue-eyed_Mary" title="Blue-eyed Mary" class="mw-redirect">Blue-eyed Mary</a> (<i>Omphalodes verna</i>), for example, there exists a gene with alleles that determine the color of flowers: blue or magenta. Another gene, however, controls whether the flowers have color at all or are white. When a plant has two copies of this white allele, its flowers are white—regardless of whether the first gene has blue or magenta alleles. This interaction between genes is called <a href="/wiki/Epistasis" title="Epistasis">epistasis</a>, with the second gene epistatic to the first.<sup id="cite_ref-griffiths2000sect644_29-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-griffiths2000sect644-29"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
	<p>Many traits are not discrete features (e.g. purple or white flowers) but are instead continuous features (e.g. human height and <a href="/wiki/Human_skin_color" title="Human skin color">skin color</a>). These <a href="/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus" title="Quantitative trait locus">complex traits</a> are products of many genes.<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> The influence of these genes is mediated, to varying degrees, by the environment an organism has experienced. The degree to which an organism's genes contribute to a complex trait is called <a href="/wiki/Heritability" title="Heritability">heritability</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-griffiths2000sect4009_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-griffiths2000sect4009-31"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> Measurement of the heritability of a trait is relative—in a more variable environment, the environment has a bigger influence on the total variation of the trait. For example, human height is a trait with complex causes. It has a heritability of 89% in the United States. In Nigeria, however, where people experience a more variable access to good nutrition and <a href="/wiki/Health_care" title="Health care">health care</a>, height has a heritability of only 62%.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

	<p>The <a href="/wiki/Molecular" title="Molecular" class="mw-redirect">molecular</a> basis for genes is <a href="/wiki/Deoxyribonucleic_acid" title="Deoxyribonucleic acid" class="mw-redirect">deoxyribonucleic acid</a> (DNA). DNA is composed of a chain of <a href="/wiki/Nucleotide" title="Nucleotide">nucleotides</a>, of which there are four types: <a href="/wiki/Adenine" title="Adenine">adenine</a> (A), <a href="/wiki/Cytosine" title="Cytosine">cytosine</a> (C), <a href="/wiki/Guanine" title="Guanine">guanine</a> (G), and <a href="/wiki/Thymine" title="Thymine">thymine</a> (T).

	<p>DNA normally exists as a double-stranded molecule, coiled into the shape of a <a href="/wiki/Double-helix" title="Double-helix" class="mw-redirect">double-helix</a>. Each nucleotide in DNA preferentially pairs with its partner nucleotide on the opposite strand: A pairs with T, and C pairs with G. Thus, in its two-stranded form, each strand effectively contains all necessary information, redundant with its partner strand. This structure of DNA is the physical basis for inheritance: <a href="/wiki/DNA_replication" title="DNA replication">DNA replication</a> duplicates the genetic information by splitting the strands and using each strand as a template for synthesis of a new partner strand.<sup id="cite_ref-griffiths2000sect1523_35-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-griffiths2000sect1523-35"><span>[</span>36<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

	<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Recombination_and_linkage">Recombination and linkage</span></h3>


	<p>The diploid nature of chromosomes allows for genes on different chromosomes to <a href="/wiki/Independent_assortment" title="Independent assortment" class="mw-redirect">assort independently</a> during sexual reproduction, recombining to form new combinations of genes. Genes on the same chromosome would theoretically never recombine, however, were it not for the process of <a href="/wiki/Chromosomal_crossover" title="Chromosomal crossover">chromosomal crossover</a>. During crossover, chromosomes exchange stretches of DNA, effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes.<sup id="cite_ref-griffiths2000sect929_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-griffiths2000sect929-41"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> This process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during <a href="/wiki/Meiosis" title="Meiosis">meiosis</a>, a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells.</p>
	<p>The probability of chromosomal crossover occurring between two given points on the chromosome is related to the distance between the points. For an arbitrarily long distance, the probability of crossover is high enough that the inheritance of the genes is effectively uncorrelated. For genes that are closer together, however, the lower probability of crossover means that the genes demonstrate <a href="/wiki/Genetic_linkage" title="Genetic linkage">genetic linkage</a>—alleles for the two genes tend to be inherited together.

	<p>Genes generally <a href="/wiki/Gene_expression" title="Gene expression">express</a> their functional effect through the production of <a href="/wiki/Protein" title="Protein">proteins</a>, which are complex molecules responsible for most functions in the cell. Proteins are made up of one or more polypeptide chains, each of which is composed of a sequence of <a href="/wiki/Amino_acid" title="Amino acid">amino acids</a>, and the DNA sequence of a gene (through an RNA intermediate) is used to produce a specific <a href="/wiki/Peptide_sequence" title="Peptide sequence">amino acid sequence</a>.

	<p>The specific sequence of amino acids <a href="/wiki/Protein_folding" title="Protein folding">results</a> in a unique three-dimensional structure for that protein, and the three-dimensional structures of proteins are related to their functions.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> Some are simple structural molecules, like the fibers formed by the protein <a href="/wiki/Collagen" title="Collagen">collagen</a>.

	<p>A <a href="/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism" title="Single-nucleotide polymorphism">single nucleotide difference</a> within DNA can cause a change in the amino acid sequence of a protein. Because protein structures are the result of their amino acid sequences, some changes can dramatically change the properties of a protein by destabilizing the structure or changing the surface of the protein in a way that changes its interaction with other proteins and molecules. For example, <a href="/wiki/Sickle-cell_anemia" title="Sickle-cell anemia" class="mw-redirect">sickle-cell anemia</a> is a <a href="/wiki/Genetic_disorder" title="Genetic disorder">human genetic disease</a> that results from a single base difference within the <a href="/wiki/Coding_region" title="Coding region">coding region</a> for the β-globin section of hemoglobin, causing a single amino acid change that changes hemoglobin's physical properties.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup> Sickle-cell versions of hemoglobin stick to themselves, stacking to form fibers that distort the shape of <a href="/wiki/Red_blood_cell" title="Red blood cell">red blood cells</a> carrying the protein.

	<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Nature_versus_nurture">Nature versus nurture</span></h3>


	<p>Although genes contain all the information an organism uses to function, the environment plays an important role in determining the ultimate phenotype—a phenomenon often referred to as "<a href="/wiki/Nature_vs._nurture" title="Nature vs. nurture" class="mw-redirect">nature vs. nurture</a>". The phenotype of an organism depends on the interaction of genetics with the environment. One example of this is the case of temperature-sensitive mutations. Often, a single amino acid change within the sequence of a protein does not change its behavior and interactions with other molecules, but it does destabilize the structure. In a high <a href="/wiki/Temperature" title="Temperature">temperature</a> environment, where molecules are moving more quickly and hitting each other, this results in the protein <a href="/wiki/Denaturation_%28biochemistry%29" title="Denaturation (biochemistry)">losing its structure</a> and failing to function. In a low temperature environment, however, the protein's structure is stable and it functions normally. This type of mutation is visible in the coat coloration of <a href="/wiki/Siamese_%28cat%29" title="Siamese (cat)">Siamese cats</a>, where a mutation in an enzyme responsible for pigment production causes it to destabilize and lose function at high temperatures.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup> The protein remains functional in areas of skin that are colder—legs, ears, tail, and face—and so the cat has dark fur at its extremities.</p>
	<p>Environment also plays a dramatic role in effects of the human genetic disease <a href="/wiki/Phenylketonuria" title="Phenylketonuria">phenylketonuria</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup> The mutation that causes phenylketonuria disrupts the ability of the body to break down the amino acid <a href="/wiki/Phenylalanine" title="Phenylalanine">phenylalanine</a>, causing a toxic build-up of an intermediate molecule that, in turn, causes severe symptoms of progressive mental retardation and seizures. If someone with the phenylketonuria mutation follows a strict diet that avoids this amino acid, however, they remain normal and healthy.</p>
	<p>A popular method to determine how much role nature and nurture play is to study identical and fraternal twins or siblings of <a href="/wiki/Multiple_birth" title="Multiple birth">multiple birth</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50"><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> Because identical siblings come from the same zygote they are genetically the same. Fraternal siblings however are as different genetically from one another as normal siblings. By comparing how often the twin of a set has the same disorder between fraternal and identical twins, scientists can see whether there is more of a nature or nurture effect. One famous example of a multiple birth study includes the <a href="/wiki/Genain_quadruplets" title="Genain quadruplets">Genain quadruplets</a>, who were <a href="/wiki/Multiple_birth" title="Multiple birth">identical quadruplets</a> all diagnosed with <a href="/wiki/Schizophrenia" title="Schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Genain_51-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Genain-51"><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

	<p><a href="/wiki/Medical_genetics" title="Medical genetics">Medical genetics</a> seeks to understand how genetic variation relates to human health and disease.<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69"><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></a></sup> When searching for an unknown gene that may be involved in a disease, researchers commonly use <a href="/wiki/Genetic_linkage" title="Genetic linkage">genetic linkage</a> and genetic <a href="/wiki/Pedigree_chart" title="Pedigree chart">pedigree charts</a> to find the location on the genome associated with the disease. At the population level, researchers take advantage of <a href="/wiki/Mendelian_randomization" title="Mendelian randomization">Mendelian randomization</a> to look for locations in the genome that are associated with diseases, a method especially useful for <a href="/wiki/Quantitative_trait_locus" title="Quantitative trait locus">multigenic traits</a> not clearly defined by a single gene.<sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70"><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></a></sup> Once a candidate gene is found, further research is often done on the corresponding gene (called an <a href="/wiki/Homology_%28biology%29#Orthology" title="Homology (biology)">orthologous</a> gene) in model organisms. In addition to studying genetic diseases, the increased availability of genotyping methods has led to the field of <a href="/wiki/Pharmacogenetics" title="Pharmacogenetics">pharmacogenetics</a>—studying how genotype can affect drug responses.<sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
	<p>Individuals differ in their inherited tendency to develop <a href="/wiki/Cancer" title="Cancer">cancer</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72"><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup> and cancer is a genetic disease.<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73"><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup> The process of cancer development in the body is a combination of events. <a href="/wiki/Mutation" title="Mutation">Mutations</a> occasionally occur within cells in the body as they divide. Although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring, they can affect the behavior of cells, sometimes causing them to grow and divide more frequently. There are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process; signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger <a href="/wiki/Apoptosis" title="Apoptosis">cell death</a>, but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages. An internal process of <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> occurs within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth, creating a cancerous tumor that grows and invades various tissues of the body.</p>
	<p>Normally, a cell divides only in response to signals: "<a href="/wiki/Growth_factors" title="Growth factors" class="mw-redirect">growth factors</a>", it stops growing when making contact with surrounding cells (<a href="/wiki/Contact_inhibition" title="Contact inhibition">contact inhibition</a>), and in response to growth inhibitory signals, it divides a limited number of times and dies (<a href="/wiki/Apoptosis" title="Apoptosis">apoptosis</a>), it stays inside the epithelium and is not able to migrate to invade other organs. To become a cancer cell, a cell has to accumulate mutations in a number of genes (3-7) that allow it to bypass all these regulations: it no longer needs growth factors to divide, it continues growing when making contact to neighbor cells, and ignores inhibitory signals, it will keep growing indefinitely and is immortal, it will escape from the epithelium and ultimately may be able to escape from the <a href="/wiki/Primary_tumor" title="Primary tumor">primary tumor</a>, cross the endothelium of a blood vessel, be transported by the bloodstream and will colonize a new organ, forming deadly <a href="/wiki/Metastasis" title="Metastasis">metastasis</a>. Although there are some genetic predispositions in a small fraction of cancers, the major fraction is due to a set of new genetic mutations that originally appear and accumulate in one or a small number of cells that will divide to form the tumor and are not transmitted to the progeny (<a href="/wiki/Somatic_mutation" title="Somatic mutation" class="mw-redirect">somatic mutations</a>). The most frequent mutations are a loss of function of <a href="/wiki/P53_protein" title="P53 protein" class="mw-redirect">p53 protein</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Tumor_suppressor" title="Tumor suppressor" class="mw-redirect">tumor suppressor</a>, or in the p53 pathway, and gain of function mutations in the <a href="/wiki/Ras_proteins" title="Ras proteins" class="mw-redirect">ras proteins</a>, or in other <a href="/wiki/Oncogene" title="Oncogene">oncogenes</a>.</p>

	<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Research_methods">Research methods</span></h3>
	<p>DNA can be manipulated in the laboratory. <a href="/wiki/Restriction_enzymes" title="Restriction enzymes" class="mw-redirect">Restriction enzymes</a> are commonly used <a href="/wiki/Enzyme" title="Enzyme">enzymes</a> that cut DNA at specific sequences, producing predictable fragments of DNA.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74"><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup> DNA fragments can be visualized through use of <a href="/wiki/Gel_electrophoresis" title="Gel electrophoresis">gel electrophoresis</a>, which separates fragments according to their length.</p>
	<p>The use of <a href="/wiki/DNA_ligase" title="DNA ligase">ligation enzymes</a> allows DNA fragments to be connected, and by ligating fragments of DNA together from different sources, researchers can create <a href="/wiki/Recombinant_DNA" title="Recombinant DNA">recombinant DNA</a>. Often associated with <a href="/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism" title="Genetically modified organism">genetically modified organisms</a>, recombinant DNA is commonly used in the context of <a href="/wiki/Plasmids" title="Plasmids" class="mw-redirect">plasmids</a>—short <a href="/wiki/Circular_DNA" title="Circular DNA">circular DNA</a> fragments with a few genes on them. By inserting plasmids into bacteria and growing those bacteria on plates of agar (to isolate <a href="/wiki/Cloning#Unicellular_organisms" title="Cloning">clones of bacteria cells</a>), researchers can clonally amplify the inserted fragment of DNA (a process known as <a href="/wiki/Molecular_cloning" title="Molecular cloning">molecular cloning</a>). (Cloning can also refer to creating <a href="/wiki/Cloning" title="Cloning">clonal organisms</a>, by various means.)</p>

	<p>DNA can also be amplified using a procedure called the <a href="/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction" title="Polymerase chain reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a> (PCR).<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75"><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup> By using specific short sequences of DNA, PCR can isolate and exponentially amplify a targeted region of DNA. Because it can amplify from extremely small amounts of DNA, PCR is also often used to detect the presence of specific DNA sequences.</p>
	<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="DNA_sequencing_and_genomics">DNA sequencing and genomics</span></h3>
	<p>One of the most fundamental technologies developed to study genetics, <a href="/wiki/DNA_sequencing" title="DNA sequencing">DNA sequencing</a> allows researchers to determine the sequence of nucleotides in DNA fragments. Developed in 1977 by <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Sanger" title="Frederick Sanger">Frederick Sanger</a> and coworkers, chain-termination sequencing is now routinely used to sequence DNA fragments.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76"><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup> With this technology researchers have been able to study the molecular sequences associated with many human diseases.</p>
	<p>As sequencing has become less expensive, researchers have <a href="/wiki/Genome_project" title="Genome project">sequenced the genomes</a> of many organisms, using computational tools to stitch together the sequences of many different fragments (a process called <a href="/wiki/Genome_assembly" title="Genome assembly" class="mw-redirect">genome assembly</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77"><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup> These technologies were used to sequence the <a href="/wiki/Human_genome" title="Human genome">human genome</a>, leading to the completion of the <a href="/wiki/Human_Genome_Project" title="Human Genome Project">Human Genome Project</a> in 2003.<sup id="cite_ref-human_genome_project_22-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-human_genome_project-22"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> New <a href="/wiki/DNA_sequencing#New_sequencing_methods" title="DNA sequencing">high-throughput sequencing</a> technologies are dramatically lowering the cost of DNA sequencing, with many researchers hoping to bring the cost of resequencing a human genome down to a thousand dollars.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78"><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
	<p>The large amount of sequence data available has created the field of <a href="/wiki/Genomics" title="Genomics">genomics</a>, research that uses computational tools to search for and analyze patterns in the full genomes of organisms. Genomics can also be considered a subfield of <a href="/wiki/Bioinformatics" title="Bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a>, which uses computational approaches to analyze large sets of <a href="/wiki/Biological_data" title="Biological data">biological data</a>.<br style="clear: both;"></p>
